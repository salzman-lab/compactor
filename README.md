# compactor
Implementation of compactors used in Tabula Sapiens Smart-Seq 2 analysis. 

Compactors are seed-based contigs constrained to FASTQ read-length. NOMAD-called anchors are taken as input and >= 1 compactors are generated to represent all downstream sequence diversity captured in raw FASTQ reads.
